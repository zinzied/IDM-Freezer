## Disclaimer
I would like to make it clear that I am not the original creator of this script. 
When I first uploaded this script to GitHub, the main author had not yet established an official GitHub repository. 
Consequently, users had to go to the official forum to download and use the script until the GitHub repository was eventually created.
My primary goal in setting up this repository was to simplify the process for users. Additionally, 
I made sure to acknowledge the original creators of the script to show respect for their work.
